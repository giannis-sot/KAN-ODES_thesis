I used Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an underlying architecture in Neural ODEs to model Lotka-Volterra and Burgers differential equations.
For this purpose 2 Python libraries were used: jaxKAN (https://jaxkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html) and Diffrax (https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/).
